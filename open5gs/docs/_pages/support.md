### Open5GS Licensing

Open5GS is licensed under a dual licensing model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial and open source projects.

### For Commercial Projects

Commercial distributors that develop and distribute commercially licensed Open5GS software and do not wish their software under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License (the “AGPL-3.0”) must enter into a commercial license agreement with [NextEPC, Inc.](https://nextepc.com)

Please contact [sales@nextepc.com](mailto:sales@nextepc.com) for more informations.

### For Open Source Projects

For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the AGPL-3.0 that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with Open5GS software, Open5GS open source software licensed under the AGPL-3.0 is the best option.

[sysmocom](https://sysmocom.de/) is providing commercial services around Open5GS
 open source software including support, development, consulting, training and system integration.

Please contact [Harald Welte \<sales@sysmocom.de\>](mailto:sales@sysmocom.de) for any related inquiries.
