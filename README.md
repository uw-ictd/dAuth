**UERANSIM** <small>(pronounced "ju-i ræn sɪm")</small>, is the open-source state-of-the-art 5G UE and RAN (gNodeB)
implementation. It can be considered as a 5G mobile phone and a base station in basic terms. The project can be used for
testing 5G Core Network and studying 5G System.

UERANSIM introduces the world's first and only open source 5G-SA UE and gNodeB implementation.
Some parts of this software are patent pending.

## Current Status

Our UE and gNodeB are functional and ready to use. You can connect them to your 5G core network right now and start
using it.

In terms of 3GPP coverage, fundamental control plane features are done. However, some of them are in progress.
More details can be found at [Feature Set](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM/wiki/Feature-Set).

Meanwhile, 5G-NR radio interface is partially implemented, and simulated over UDP protocol.
